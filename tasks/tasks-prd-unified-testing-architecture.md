# Unified Testing Session Architecture - Implementation Tasks

**Generated from:** `prd-unified-testing-architecture.md`
**Date:** July 25, 2025 - Updated with Current Status
**Project:** VPAT Accessibility Testing Platform

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### **Current Error Blocking Progress:**

**Testing session creation is failing with database column mismatch error:**

```
Error creating testing session: error: column "user_id" of relation "test_audit_log" does not exist
```

**Root Cause:** In `api/routes/testing-sessions.js` line ~422, the audit log INSERT statement uses `user_id` but the `test_audit_log` table schema has `changed_by` column instead.

**Fix Required:** Change `user_id` to `changed_by` in the audit log INSERT statement in the `generateTestInstances` function.

### **Application Status:**

- ‚úÖ Backend API Server: Running on port 3001
- ‚úÖ Frontend Dashboard: Running on port 8081
- ‚úÖ Database: PostgreSQL connected and populated with WCAG/Section 508 requirements
- ‚úÖ WebSocket: Connected and functional
- ‚ùå **Testing Sessions Creation: BLOCKED by column name mismatch**

### **Testing Sessions Tab Status:**

- ‚úÖ Frontend UI: Fully implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Navigation: Fixed and enabled
- ‚úÖ Database Constraints: Fixed (added 'draft' status support)
- ‚úÖ Frontend Integration: Complete with backend APIs
- ‚ùå **Session Creation: Failing on final audit log step**

### **Previous Fixes Applied:**

1. Fixed navigation to call `loadTestingSessionsView()` instead of `loadComplianceSessions()`
2. Removed `hasWebCrawlerData()` restriction that was disabling the tab
3. Updated database constraint to allow `'draft'` status in addition to `'planning'`
4. Created missing `test_audit_log` table
5. **NEXT:** Fix column name mismatch (`user_id` ‚Üí `changed_by`)

- WebSocket integration is functional for real-time progress updates during test execution
- Authentication and authorization patterns from existing user management are correctly implemented

### Critical Learnings from Previous Implementations

#### Database Architecture Lessons

- **Single Source of Truth**: Previous issues with file-based vs database storage (`fm-session.json` vs `crawler_auth_sessions`) showed the importance of consistent database-first architecture
- **Project Context**: All sessions must be properly associated with projects for multi-project support and proper data isolation
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Every test change needs automatic logging with full context, user tracking, and IP logging for enterprise compliance
- **Migration Safety**: All data migrations need rollback procedures and backward compatibility to prevent data loss
- **Column Name Consistency**: Critical to match INSERT statement column names with actual table schema (current issue: `user_id` vs `changed_by`)

#### Frontend Architecture Patterns

- **Dual State Management**: The dashboard uses both organized state (`this.data`) and legacy state for template compatibility - both must be synchronized
- **Method Consolidation**: Always check for duplicate methods that can override fixes (common pattern: one method for ID, another for object)
- **API Consistency**: Use centralized `apiCall()` helper instead of direct `fetch()` calls for authentication token handling
- **Component Loading**: Use stable backup files (`.bak2`) for working implementations rather than incomplete current versions

#### Authentication & Session Management

- **Database-First Sessions**: Session capture must save to `crawler_auth_sessions` table, not files, for real-time updates and proper relationships
- **Project Association**: All authentication sessions need `project_id` and `crawler_id` for proper data relationships
- **State Synchronization**: Authentication state must sync between organized (`this.auth.isAuthenticated`) and legacy (`isAuthenticated`) systems

#### UI/UX Consistency Principles

- **Cross-Tab Consistency**: All tabs should use identical CSS classes, styling patterns, and interaction behaviors for user familiarity
- **Project Selection Propagation**: Selected projects must propagate across all tabs with localStorage persistence for page refresh
- **Modal Standardization**: All modals should follow the same structural patterns, styling, and functionality for consistency
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with working stable patterns and enhance rather than rebuilding from scratch

#### Testing & Validation Strategies

- **Complete Method Transfer**: When moving functionality, transfer complete implementations including helper methods and error handling
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API patterns and data structures during transitions to prevent breaking changes
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSocket patterns for progress tracking and status updates during long-running operations
- **Enterprise Audit Requirements**: All changes need comprehensive logging with user context, timestamps, and change details

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS: Testing Sessions Architecture 95% Complete**

**Implementation Status**: The unified testing session architecture is nearly complete and functional.

### **Database Status:**

```sql
-- Requirements successfully populated:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test_requirements; 
-- Result: 43 rows (26 WCAG + 17 Section 508)

-- WCAG 2.1 Coverage: Level A (18), AA (4), AAA (4)
-- Section 508 Coverage: Base (15), Enhanced (2)
```

### **Frontend Status:**

- ‚úÖ Testing Sessions tab fully implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Session creation modal with advanced features (conformance levels, requirements preview, templates)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive session dashboard with filtering, progress tracking, and management
- ‚úÖ Navigation fixed and tab enabled
- ‚úÖ All UI components integrated with backend APIs

### **Backend API Status:**

- ‚úÖ Complete CRUD operations for testing sessions (`/api/testing-sessions`)
- ‚úÖ Automatic requirement population based on conformance levels
- ‚úÖ Progress calculation and statistics
- ‚úÖ Session duplication functionality
- ‚úÖ Test instances API with URL-to-requirement mapping (`/api/test-instances`)
- ‚ùå **SINGLE BLOCKING ISSUE**: Audit log column name mismatch

### **What Works:**

- User can navigate to Testing Sessions tab
- User can see project stats and existing sessions
- Backend APIs respond correctly to authenticated requests
- Database queries work for fetching sessions and requirements
- Frontend correctly calculates total discovered pages

### **What's Blocked:**

- Creating new testing sessions fails at the final audit log step
- Error: `column "user_id" of relation "test_audit_log" does not exist`
- Solution: Change `user_id` to `changed_by` in `api/routes/testing-sessions.js`
