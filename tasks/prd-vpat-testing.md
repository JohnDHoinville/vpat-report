# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Automated Accessibility Testing Platform for WCAG 2.2 & Section 508 Compliance

### Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive automated accessibility testing platform that provides continuous WCAG 2.2 Level AA/AAA and Section 508 compliance monitoring for web applications, with automated VPAT generation and real-time violation detection.

---

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

- Manual accessibility testing is time-consuming and inconsistent
- WCAG 2.2 compliance requires testing ~78 criteria, but current tools only cover ~20%
- Section 508 compliance documentation (VPAT) generation is manual and error-prone
- No unified platform exists for comprehensive accessibility monitoring across development lifecycle

### 1.2 Solution

An integrated automated accessibility testing platform that:

- Provides multi-tool testing pipeline covering maximum WCAG criteria
- Generates automated VPAT reports for Section 508 compliance
- Integrates seamlessly into CI/CD workflows
- Offers real-time monitoring and alerting
- Supports developer workflow integration

### 1.3 Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: Test 90%+ of automatable WCAG 2.2 criteria
- **Speed**: Complete accessibility scan in <5 minutes for typical application
- **Accuracy**: <5% false positive rate on violation detection
- **Adoption**: 100% developer team integration within 6 months
- **Compliance**: Automated VPAT generation with 95%+ accuracy

### 1.4 What is NOT Being Tested (Manual Testing Required)

The following accessibility areas **cannot be automated** and require dedicated manual testing:

#### Areas Requiring 100% Manual Testing:
- **Keyboard Navigation Flow**: Actual tab order experience, focus trapping in modals, skip link functionality
- **Screen Reader User Experience**: Quality of announcements, reading order, context understanding
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Content comprehension, language clarity, reading level assessment
- **Focus Management**: Focus restoration after interactions, logical focus movement
- **Error Recovery**: User ability to understand and correct form errors
- **Content Quality**: Meaningful alt text accuracy, heading structure logic, link purpose clarity
- **User Context**: Understanding of page purpose, navigation consistency, help availability
- **Timing and Motion**: Animation effects on users, timeout appropriateness, pause/stop controls
- **Audio/Video Content**: Captions accuracy, audio descriptions quality, transcript completeness

#### Areas with Limited Automation (Require Manual Verification):
- **Color Accessibility**: Tools detect contrast but not color-only information conveyance
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Touch target sizes detected, but gesture alternatives require manual testing
- **Form Accessibility**: Label detection automated, but error message quality needs human assessment
- **Dynamic Content**: ARIA live regions detected, but announcement timing/appropriateness requires testing

#### Coverage Limitations:
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA**: Automated testing covers approximately **45-55%** of all 78 success criteria
- **WCAG 2.2 Level AAA**: Automated testing covers approximately **35-45%** of all AAA success criteria  
- **Section 508**: Automated testing covers approximately **40-50%** of Section 508 requirements
- **Overall Compliance Confidence**: Automated testing provides **~50%** confidence in full accessibility compliance

#### Why Manual Testing Remains Critical:
- **User Experience Quality**: Automated tools cannot assess if accessibility features work well for actual users
- **Context Sensitivity**: Many accessibility requirements depend on content context and user intent
- **Subjective Assessment**: Criteria like "meaningful" alt text or "clear" instructions require human judgment
- **Complex Interactions**: Multi-step processes and complex UI patterns need human validation
- **Assistive Technology Compatibility**: Real screen reader and voice recognition software testing required

**Important Note**: This platform significantly accelerates accessibility testing by handling all automatable checks, but organizations must budget for comprehensive manual testing to achieve full WCAG 2.2 and Section 508 compliance.
