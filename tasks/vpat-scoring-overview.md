## Scoring Methodology

### Overall Compliance Score Calculation

Our platform generates an **Overall Compliance Score (0-100)** based on weighted analysis across all executed accessibility tests. The score represents the percentage of accessibility requirements your site successfully meets.

**Formula:**
```
Overall Score = Σ(Test Results × WCAG Principle Weights × Test Type Mappings)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Passed Tests**: Accessibility requirements successfully met
- **Failed Tests**: Violations requiring remediation
- **Test Coverage**: Breadth of accessibility testing performed
- **WCAG Principle Alignment**: Mapping to the four core accessibility principles

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance Framework

### The Four Principles of Accessibility

Our scoring system maps all test results to the **WCAG 2.1 Four Principles**, each weighted based on user impact:

#### 1. **Perceivable (30% Weight)**
- **Definition**: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Key Areas**: Color contrast, alternative text, audio/video accessibility
- **Business Impact**: Users with visual or hearing impairments can access content

#### 2. **Operable (30% Weight)**
- **Definition**: Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Key Areas**: Keyboard navigation, timing, seizure prevention
- **Business Impact**: Users with motor disabilities can interact with your site

#### 3. **Understandable (20% Weight)**
- **Definition**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
- **Key Areas**: Form labels, error handling, consistent navigation
- **Business Impact**: Users with cognitive disabilities can comprehend content

#### 4. **Robust (20% Weight)**
- **Definition**: Content must be robust enough for assistive technologies
- **Key Areas**: Valid code, compatibility with screen readers
- **Business Impact**: Future-proof accessibility as technologies evolve

### Compliance Thresholds

| **Level** | **Score Range** | **WCAG Conformance** | **Legal Standing** |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **WCAG AAA** | 95-100 | Enhanced Accessibility | Exceeds Requirements |
| **WCAG AA** | 80-94 | Standard Compliance | Meets Legal Requirements |
| **WCAG A** | 60-79 | Basic Accessibility | Partial Compliance |
| **Non-Compliant** | 0-59 | Below Standards | Legal Risk |
