# Product Requirements Document: Dashboard Component Migration

## Introduction/Overview

The current VPAT accessibility testing dashboard is implemented as a single monolithic 12,924-line `dashboard.js` file using Alpine.js. This architecture has become difficult to maintain, leading to frequent UI bugs, development conflicts, and extended debugging sessions. 

**Goal**: Migrate the dashboard from a monolithic Alpine.js implementation to a modular, maintainable component architecture using React while preserving the existing UX/UI and ensuring gradual, tested migration.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Development Friction**: Eliminate hours spent fighting Alpine.js errors and UI bugs
2. **Improve Maintainability**: Break the 12,924-line file into manageable, focused components
3. **Enable Safe Feature Development**: Allow isolated feature development and testing without breaking other areas
4. **Preserve User Experience**: Maintain 100% of the current look and feel during migration
5. **Enable Coexistence**: Allow React and Alpine.js to work together during the migration period
6. **Reduce File Sizes**: Create smaller, focused files that are easier to understand and modify

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- **Story 1**: As a developer, I want to work on authentication features without worrying about breaking the automation testing interface, so that I can develop faster and with confidence
- **Story 2**: As a developer, I want to modify the web crawler interface without fighting Alpine.js state management issues, so that I can focus on business logic instead of framework debugging
- **Story 3**: As a developer, I want clear component boundaries so that I can understand what each piece does and test it in isolation

### As a Product Owner
- **Story 4**: As a product owner, I want the migration to be invisible to users so that there's no disruption to existing workflows
- **Story 5**: As a product owner, I want each migrated feature to be thoroughly tested and approved before moving to the next so that we maintain system stability

### As a User
- **Story 6**: As a user, I want the dashboard to continue working exactly as it does today so that I don't need to relearn any interfaces
- **Story 7**: As a user, I want the same visual design and interaction patterns so that my muscle memory and workflows remain intact

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Extract Utilities (Foundation)
1. **FR-1.1**: The system must extract all utility functions (formatters, validators, constants) into separate files under `dashboard/js/utils/`
2. **FR-1.2**: The system must extract all data transformation helpers (date formatting, status mapping, etc.) into `dashboard/js/helpers/`
3. **FR-1.3**: The system must create a constants file containing all magic strings, API endpoints, and configuration values
4. **FR-1.4**: The system must ensure all utility functions have no external dependencies and can be imported by both Alpine.js and React

### Phase 2: Extract Services (API Layer)
5. **FR-2.1**: The system must create a centralized API service layer in `dashboard/js/services/` that handles all HTTP requests
6. **FR-2.2**: The system must extract authentication service logic into `AuthService.js` with methods for login, logout, token management
7. **FR-2.3**: The system must extract project management API calls into `ProjectService.js`
8. **FR-2.4**: The system must extract web crawler API calls into `CrawlerService.js`
9. **FR-2.5**: The system must extract testing session API calls into `TestingService.js`
10. **FR-2.6**: The system must extract automation API calls into `AutomationService.js`
11. **FR-2.7**: The system must extract manual testing API calls into `ManualTestingService.js`
12. **FR-2.8**: The system must extract reporting API calls into `ReportingService.js`

### Phase 3: Component Migration by Feature
13. **FR-3.1**: The system must migrate the authentication interface to a React component while maintaining exact visual design
14. **FR-3.2**: The system must migrate the web crawler interface to React components with identical functionality
15. **FR-3.3**: The system must migrate project/session management to React components preserving all current workflows
16. **FR-3.4**: The system must migrate the automated testing interface to React components with same UX patterns
17. **FR-3.5**: The system must migrate the manual testing interface to React components maintaining review process flows
18. **FR-3.6**: The system must migrate the reporting interface to React components with identical data visualization

### Phase 4: Global State Management
19. **FR-4.1**: The system must implement React Context or Redux for global state management
20. **FR-4.2**: The system must migrate shared state (user auth, current project, session data) to the new state management
21. **FR-4.3**: The system must ensure state synchronization between Alpine.js and React during coexistence period
22. **FR-4.4**: The system must provide state persistence for user preferences and session data

### Cross-Phase Requirements
23. **FR-X.1**: Each migrated component must pass visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency
24. **FR-X.2**: Each migrated component must maintain exact keyboard navigation patterns
25. **FR-X.3**: Each migrated component must preserve all accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management)
26. **FR-X.4**: Each migrated component must handle the same error states with identical user messaging
27. **FR-X.5**: The system must maintain WebSocket connectivity and real-time updates throughout migration
28. **FR-X.6**: Each phase must be deployable independently without breaking existing functionality

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **UI/UX Redesign**: No changes to visual design, layout, or user interaction patterns
2. **Backend API Changes**: No modifications to existing API endpoints or data structures
3. **Performance Optimization**: Performance improvements are not the primary goal (though may be a side effect)
4. **New Feature Development**: No new features should be added during migration
5. **Framework Migration from Alpine.js**: Alpine.js will remain for parts not yet migrated
6. **Database Schema Changes**: No backend database modifications
7. **Authentication System Overhaul**: Existing JWT authentication system remains unchanged

## Design Considerations

### React-Alpine.js Coexistence Strategy
- Use React Portal rendering for migrated components
- Maintain Alpine.js for non-migrated sections
- Implement event bridge for cross-framework communication
- Use CSS isolation to prevent style conflicts

### Component Architecture
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement consistent prop interfaces
- Create reusable UI components matching current design system

### State Management
- Use React Context for component-local state
- Implement Redux Toolkit for complex global state
- Create adapters for Alpine.js-React state synchronization
- Maintain single source of truth for shared data

### Testing Strategy
- Visual regression testing for each migrated component
- Integration tests for Alpine.js-React interaction
- Unit tests for extracted utilities and services
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows

## Technical Considerations

### Coexistence Requirements
- **Bundle Strategy**: Use webpack to create separate bundles for React components
- **CSS Isolation**: Use CSS modules or styled-components to prevent style conflicts
- **State Bridge**: Implement custom hooks to sync state between frameworks
- **Event System**: Create unified event system for cross-component communication

2. **Testing Library**: Prefer React Testing Library or Enzyme for component testing?
3. **State Management**: Use Context + useReducer or full Redux Toolkit implementation?
4. **Build Process**: Integrate with existing build pipeline or create separate React build?
5. **Browser Support**: Maintain same browser support requirements as current Alpine.js implementation?
6. **Error Boundaries**: How should React error boundaries integrate with existing error handling?
7. **Hot Reloading**: Enable React hot reloading during development while maintaining Alpine.js sections?

## Approval Gates
