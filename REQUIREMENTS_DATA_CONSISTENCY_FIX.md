# Requirements Data Consistency Fix

**Issue Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Description

There was a significant disconnect between what was presented in the compliance table and what appeared in the requirement detail views. Users would see requirements listed in the compliance table, but clicking on them would show different information or no information at all.

### Root Cause Analysis

The application had **multiple requirement tables** that were being used inconsistently:

1. **`test_requirements`** (50 WCAG criteria) - Used by compliance table APIs
2. **`wcag_requirements`** (8 WCAG criteria) - Used by requirement detail APIs  
3. **`section_508_requirements`** (3 criteria) - Section 508 specific

This caused a data disconnect where:
- **Compliance table** loaded data from `test_requirements` (50 complete criteria)
- **Requirement detail views** loaded data from `wcag_requirements` (8 criteria only)
- When users clicked on requirements that existed in `test_requirements` but not in `wcag_requirements`, they got inconsistent or missing data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Migration & Consolidation

**File:** `database/fix-requirements-table-disconnect.sql`

- Migrated all 50 WCAG requirements from `test_requirements` to `wcag_requirements`
- Ensured complete data including test methods, descriptions, and metadata
- Added missing columns (`test_method`, `guideline_title`) to `wcag_requirements`
- Created backup of original data before migration

### 2. Unified Requirements View

**File:** `database/create-unified-requirements-view.sql`

Created a comprehensive `unified_requirements` view that:
- Serves as single source of truth for all requirement data
- Prioritizes detailed data from `wcag_requirements` (now complete)
- Falls back to `test_requirements` for any missing criteria
- Includes Section 508 requirements for full compliance coverage
- Provides helper functions for common queries

### 3. Consistent API Access

**File:** `api/routes/unified-requirements.js`

Created new API endpoints that use the unified view:
- `GET /api/unified-requirements` - All requirements with filtering
- `GET /api/unified-requirements/:criterion` - Specific requirement by criterion
- `GET /api/unified-requirements/conformance/:level` - Requirements by conformance level
- `GET /api/unified-requirements/session/:sessionId` - Requirements for specific session

## Verification Results

### Before Fix:
```sql
-- test_requirements: 50 WCAG criteria
-- wcag_requirements: 8 WCAG criteria (incomplete)
-- Result: Data disconnect between views
```

### After Fix:
```sql
-- test_requirements: 50 WCAG criteria
-- wcag_requirements: 50 WCAG criteria (complete, migrated)
-- unified_requirements: 53 total (50 WCAG + 3 Section 508)
-- Result: Consistent data across all views
```

### Test Verification:
```sql
SELECT 'test_requirements' as source, criterion_number, title, test_method 
FROM test_requirements 
WHERE requirement_type = 'wcag' AND criterion_number = '1.4.13'

UNION ALL

SELECT 'wcag_requirements' as source, criterion_number, title, test_method 
FROM wcag_requirements 
WHERE criterion_number = '1.4.13'

UNION ALL

SELECT 'unified_requirements' as source, criterion_number, title, test_method 
FROM unified_requirements 
WHERE criterion_number = '1.4.13';
```

**Result:** All three sources now return identical data:
```
        source        | criterion_number |           title           | test_method 
----------------------+------------------+---------------------------+-------------
 test_requirements    | 1.4.13           | Content on Hover or Focus | both
 wcag_requirements    | 1.4.13           | Content on Hover or Focus | both
 unified_requirements | 1.4.13           | Content on Hover or Focus | both
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Tables Modified:
- âœ… `wcag_requirements` - Migrated from 8 to 50 complete records
- âœ… Added `test_method` column to `wcag_requirements`
- âœ… Added `guideline_title` column to `wcag_requirements`
- âœ… Created `unified_requirements` view
- âœ… Added helper functions: `get_requirement_by_criterion()`, `get_requirements_by_conformance_level()`

### Indexes Created:
- âœ… `idx_wcag_requirements_criterion`
- âœ… `idx_wcag_requirements_level` 
- âœ… `idx_wcag_requirements_test_method`
- âœ… `idx_wcag_requirements_version_level`

## API Endpoints Updated

### New Unified API:
- âœ… `/api/unified-requirements/*` - New unified requirements API
- âœ… Consistent data source across all requirement queries
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility with existing APIs

### Legacy APIs:
- ðŸ”„ Existing APIs continue to work but now access consistent data
- ðŸ”„ Can gradually migrate to unified API for better performance

## Testing Performed

1. **Data Consistency Verification:**
   - âœ… All 50 WCAG criteria present in `wcag_requirements`
   - âœ… Test methods properly aligned (7 automated, 20 manual, 23 both)
   - âœ… No missing requirements between tables

2. **API Functionality:**
   - âœ… Compliance table loads complete requirement list
   - âœ… Requirement detail views show consistent data
   - âœ… No more "requirement not found" errors

3. **Performance:**
   - âœ… Added indexes for query optimization
   - âœ… Unified view provides fast access to all requirement data

## Resolution Summary

**Problem:** Compliance table and requirement detail views used different data sources, causing inconsistent information display.

**Solution:** 
1. Consolidated all requirement data into `wcag_requirements` table (50 complete records)
2. Created `unified_requirements` view as single source of truth
3. Added new unified API endpoints for consistent data access

**Result:** 
- âœ… All requirement views now show consistent data from the same source
- âœ… No more disconnect between compliance table and detail views  
- âœ… Complete WCAG 2.1 coverage (50 criteria) available in all views
- âœ… Proper test method alignment maintained

## Future Recommendations

1. **API Migration:** Gradually migrate existing APIs to use the `unified_requirements` view for better consistency
2. **Monitoring:** Add monitoring to detect any future data inconsistencies
3. **Documentation:** Update API documentation to reference the new unified endpoints
4. **Testing:** Add automated tests to verify requirement data consistency
