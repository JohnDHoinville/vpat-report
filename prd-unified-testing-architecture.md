**Status:** Draft  

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Transform the VPAT reporting system from an ad-hoc testing tool into an enterprise-grade accessibility compliance management platform that provides complete audit trails, standardized testing workflows, and professional VPAT generation capabilities.

### Current State vs. Future State
- **Current**: Split data models causing complex UNION queries, incomplete audit trails, difficult results viewing
- **Future**: Unified testing sessions with pre-defined compliance tests, comprehensive audit logging, professional progress tracking

### Business Impact
- **Compliance**: Meet enterprise audit requirements with complete testing documentation
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined testing workflows with clear progress tracking
- **Quality**: Standardized testing approach ensuring comprehensive coverage
- **Scalability**: Professional platform capable of handling multiple concurrent audits

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Architecture Issues
1. **Complex Data Model**: Three separate tables (`violations`, `automated_test_results`, `manual_test_results`) require error-prone UNION queries
2. **Incomplete Audit Trail**: No comprehensive tracking of who did what when during testing process
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users can't easily see complete testing progress or results
4. **Technical Debt**: "UNION types uuid and text cannot be matched" errors breaking functionality
5. **Limited Compliance**: Current approach doesn't meet enterprise audit requirements

### Business Problems
- **Auditor Confusion**: External auditors can't verify testing methodology completeness
- **Team Coordination**: Manual testers don't have clear task assignments or progress visibility
- **Quality Assurance**: No way to verify testing thoroughness or reviewer oversight
- **Client Reporting**: Cannot demonstrate systematic compliance testing approach

---

## Solution Overview

### Unified Testing Session Architecture
Replace current ad-hoc testing with structured testing sessions that:
- Pre-create all required tests based on selected compliance level (WCAG A/AA/AAA, Section 508)
- Provide unified data model for all test results
- Maintain comprehensive audit trail of all testing activities
- Enable professional progress tracking and reporting

### Key Innovation: Pre-Defined Test Matrix
Instead of discovering issues and creating records, create complete test matrix upfront:
- **Session Creation**: User selects conformance level ‚Üí System creates all applicable tests
- **Test Execution**: Automated tools and manual testers update pre-existing test records
- **Dynamic Discovery**: New findings map to existing requirements or create new tests
- **Audit Trail**: Every change tracked with full context and timeline

- **Feature Flags**: Toggle between old/new functionality during testing
- **Data Preservation**: All existing data migrated to new structure
- **URL Compatibility**: Maintain existing routes during transition
- **Training Minimal**: UI familiarity reduces learning curve

### üéØ **Strategic Benefits**
- **Reduced Risk**: Preserve working components, only change what's necessary
- **Faster Development**: Leverage existing UI components and patterns
- **User Adoption**: Familiar interface accelerates team acceptance
- **Proven Stability**: Keep battle-tested authentication and infrastructure
- **Cost Effective**: Major refactor vs. complete rebuild timeline/budget
