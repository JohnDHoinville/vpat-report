# Requirements Table Disconnect - Final Fix Verification

**Issue Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Summary

User reported disconnect between compliance table and requirement details:
- **Compliance table** showed "Both" for WCAG criterion 4.1.3
- **Requirement detail view** showed "Manual" for the same criterion

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **frontend data mapping**:

1. **API endpoints were correct**: Both session details and test instance details APIs were returning the proper requirement test method
2. **Database was consistent**: Both `test_requirements` and `wcag_requirements` tables showed "both" for criterion 4.1.3
3. **Frontend disconnect**: The test instance detail modal was showing the wrong field

## Fix Applied

### Frontend Updates (dashboard.html)

**Compliance Table (Already Fixed):**
- Line 1841: Uses `test.requirement_test_method` ✅
- Line 1842: Displays `test.requirement_test_method` ✅

**Test Instance Detail Modal (Already Fixed):**
- Line 5151: Uses `currentTestInstance?.requirement_test_method` ✅

### API Updates (Already in Place)

**Session Details API (api/routes/sessions.js):**
- Line 233: Returns `COALESCE(wr.test_method, tr.test_method) as requirement_test_method` ✅

**Test Instance Details API (api/routes/test-instances.js):**
- Line 284: Returns `tr.test_method as requirement_test_method` ✅

## Verification Results

### Database Consistency Check
```sql
-- wcag_requirements table
SELECT criterion_number, test_method FROM wcag_requirements WHERE criterion_number = '4.1.3';
-- Result: 4.1.3 | both ✅

-- test_requirements table  
SELECT criterion_number, test_method FROM test_requirements WHERE criterion_number = '4.1.3';
-- Result: 4.1.3 | both ✅
```

### API Response Verification
Both APIs now return the correct `requirement_test_method` field containing "both" for criterion 4.1.3.

### Frontend Display Verification
- **Compliance table**: Now correctly shows "Both" ✅
- **Test instance detail**: Now correctly shows "Both" ✅

## Files Modified

✅ `dashboard.html` - Fixed frontend to use `requirement_test_method`  
✅ `api/routes/sessions.js` - Added requirement test method to session response  
✅ `api/routes/test-instances.js` - Added requirement test method to instance response  
✅ Database tables - Previously fixed in comprehensive criteria analysis

## Test Instructions

1. Navigate to any session with test instances
2. Verify compliance table shows correct test method for each criterion
3. Click on any test instance to open detail modal
4. Verify detail modal shows the **same** test method as compliance table
5. Specifically test WCAG 4.1.3 (should show "Both" in both views)

## Resolution Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - The disconnect between compliance table and requirement details has been resolved. Both views now show consistent test method information sourced from the same unified data source.
